# Sales Data Analysis and Forecasting

## Project Overview
This project performs an end-to-end data analysis on sales data for a warehouse and retail company. Using Python, the analysis explores sales trends, correlation between key metrics, time-series forecasting, customer segmentation, and anomaly detection. This analysis is intended to guide business decision-making through insights on seasonal trends, top-selling products, supplier contributions, and predictive sales modeling.

## Project Objectives
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and key contributors to sales.
- Run correlation analysis on sales metrics to identify dependencies.
- Forecast future sales using time-series analysis.
- (Optional) Segment customers for targeted marketing.
- Detect anomalies in sales data for monitoring irregular patterns.
- Generate actionable recommendations based on insights.

## Repository Contents
- `Warehouse_and_Retail_Sales.csv`: Sample dataset for warehouse and retail sales (uploaded by user).
- `sales_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with code for each analysis step.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.
- Generated files:
  - `correlation_matrix.csv`: Correlation analysis results.
  - `monthly_sales_trends.png`: Monthly sales trend visualization.
  - `top_suppliers_by_sales.png`: Visualization of top suppliers by retail sales.
  - `retail_sales_forecast.csv`: Forecasted sales data for the next 12 months.

## Project Structure

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Load the sales dataset, handle missing values, and format columns.
   - Generate basic descriptive statistics to understand dataset composition.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Monthly sales trend analysis for retail and warehouse sales.
   - Sales distribution analysis by item type.
   - Identification of top suppliers by retail sales.

3. **Correlation Analysis**
   - Calculate and visualize the correlation between `RETAIL SALES`, `RETAIL TRANSFERS`, and `WAREHOUSE SALES`.
   - Results saved as `correlation_matrix.csv`.

4. **Time-Series Forecasting**
   - Use Exponential Smoothing to forecast retail sales for the next 12 months.
   - Visualization and forecast results saved to `retail_sales_forecast.csv`.

5. **Customer Segmentation** *(Optional)* 
   - Apply K-Means clustering to segment customers based on purchase behavior (if applicable).
   - Visualize customer segments and tailor recommendations accordingly.

6. **Anomaly Detection**
   - Use Z-score analysis to detect unusual spikes or drops in retail sales.
   - Visualize anomalies for further investigation and monitoring.

7. **Report Generation**
   - Example PDF report generation using `FPDF` library with key insights and visualizations.

## Usage Instructions

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3.x and the following libraries installed:
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scipy`
- `statsmodels`
- `fpdf`

You can install the required packages using:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scipy statsmodels fpdf
```

### Running the Analysis
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sales-data-analysis.git
   cd sales-data-analysis
   ```

2. **Open the Jupyter Notebook**:
   Run the `sales_analysis.ipynb` notebook to execute each analysis step. Each section in the notebook is organized in the order described above.

3. **Generate Reports**:
   - The notebook will generate visualizations and save analysis results in `.csv` files.
   - Example PDF reports and charts are generated within the notebook.

## Key Insights and Recommendations
- **Seasonal Sales Trends**: Seasonal trends in monthly sales suggest a focus on high-demand periods.
- **Top-Selling Item Types**: Prioritize stock for popular item types to maintain inventory.
- **Supplier Analysis**: Work with top suppliers for potential bulk orders or joint promotions.
- **Forecasting**: Use 12-month sales forecasts to plan for future demand.
- **Anomaly Monitoring**: Periodically check for anomalies to detect unexpected sales patterns early.

## Next Steps
- **Automation**: Use scheduling tools like Airflow or cron jobs to automate the analysis and report generation.
- **Advanced Forecasting**: Experiment with ARIMA or other advanced models for long-term forecasting.
- **Additional Segmentation**: Enhance segmentation analysis if more customer data becomes available.
